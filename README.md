# 💳 Credit Risk Analytics

A comprehensive **Data Analytics Project in the Banking Domain** focused on understanding and minimizing credit risk while lending to customers. This project applies **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI** to explore, process, and visualize financial data — helping financial institutions make **data-driven lending decisions** and reduce loan default risks.

## 🎯 **Objective**

To develop a clear understanding of **Risk Analytics** in banking and financial services by analyzing customer data and identifying the factors that contribute to **loan default risk**.  
The goal is to use data insights to **Minimize Financial Loss** and support **smarter credit decisions**.

---

## ⚙️ **Tools & Technologies**

- 🐍 **Python** – Data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA  
- 🗄️ **MySQL** – Data storage and querying for structured analysis  
- 📊 **Power BI** – Dashboard visualization for business insights  
- 📈 **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy  

---

## 📊 **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection & Database Setup**
   - Imported banking dataset into MySQL database (`banking_data`)
   - Connected Python with MySQL using SQLAlchemy for seamless data access

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed categorical and numerical variables
   - Examined income bands, risk weighting, loyalty classification, and occupation impact on credit risk
   - Identified missing values and outliers affecting model accuracy

3. **Risk Segmentation**
   - Classified customers by `Risk Weighting` and `Loyalty Classification`
   - Detected high-risk customer groups based on financial and demographic attributes

4. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize:
     - Credit risk distribution by income band and occupation  
     - Loan performance metrics  
     - Customer segmentation and default likelihood  

---

## 💡 **Key Insights**

- High-risk customers were concentrated in specific **income bands** and **occupational categories**.  
- Customers with **multiple credit cards** and lower loyalty ratings showed higher default risk.  
- **Loyalty Classification** and **Risk Weighting** strongly influenced the lending decisions.  
- Data-driven insights helped simulate **safer credit approval policies**.
